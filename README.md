## 📘 PROJECT OVERVIEW

THIS REPOSITORY SERVES AS A DEEP DIVE INTO THE MECHANICS OF BINARY CLASSIFICATION. INSTEAD OF RELYING ON `model.fit()`, THIS PROJECT MANUALLY IMPLEMENTS THE OPTIMIZATION LOOPS, LOG-LOSS CALCULATIONS, AND PARAMETER UPDATES. IT IS DESIGNED TO DEMONSTRATE THE MATHEMATICAL FIDELITY OF CUSTOM IMPLEMENTATIONS BY BENCHMARKING THEM AGAINST INDUSTRY-STANDARD LIBRARIES LIKE SCIKIT-LEARN AND VISUALIZING COMPLEX CONCEPTS LIKE PROBABILITY HEATMAPS AND COST SURFACES.

> THE PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO:
- REMOVE ALL ABSTRACTION
- EXPOSE THE TRUE MATHEMATICS BEHIND CLASSIFICATION
- DEMONSTRATE HOW DECISION BOUNDARIES, PROBABILITIES, AND METRICS EMERGE FROM CALCULUS AND LINEAR ALGEBRA

## 🧠 MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. THE SIGMOID ACTIVATION
$$g(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$$

### 2. LOG LOSS COST FUNCTION
$$J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} [y^{(i)} \log(h_\theta(x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log(1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)}))]$$

### 3. GRADIENT DESCENT UPDATE RULE
$$\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) x_j^{(i)}$$

### 4. REGULARIZATION TERMS
- **L2 (RIDGE):** $\frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum \theta_j^2$
- **L1 (LASSO):** $\frac{\lambda}{m} \sum |\theta_j|$
- **ELASTIC NET:** MIXTURE OF L1 AND L2

## 📊 VISUALIZATION HIGHLIGHTS

- **DECISION BOUNDARY:** PLOTS THE LINEAR SEPARATOR OVER CLASS SCATTER PLOTS.
- **PROBABILITY HEATMAP:** VISUALIZES THE MODEL'S CONFIDENCE ACROSS THE ENTIRE FEATURE SPACE.
- **3D COST SURFACE:** INTERACTIVE VIEW OF THE COST FUNCTION LANDSCAPE AND THE OPTIMAL MINIMUM.
- **THRESHOLD TRADE-OFF:** CURVES SHOWING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRECISION, RECALL, AND DECISION THRESHOLDS.
- **CONVERGENCE GRAPHS:** TRACKS COST REDUCTION OVER ITERATIONS FOR DIFFERENT LEARNING RATES.

## ⚙️ HOW IT WORKS

1.  **DATA LOADING:** READS RAW CSV DATA AND PERFORMS MIN-MAX NORMALIZATION.
2.  **MODEL INITIALIZATION:** SETS HYPERPARAMETERS (LEARNING RATE, ITERATIONS, REGULARIZATION TYPE).
3.  **TRAINING LOOP:**
    * COMPUTES LINEAR PREDICTION ($z = \theta^T x$).
    * APPLIES SIGMOID ACTIVATION ($h = \sigma(z)$).
    * CALCULATES GRADIENTS WITH REGULARIZATION DERIVATIVE.
    * UPDATES WEIGHTS.
4.  **PREDICTION:** OUTPUTS PROBABILITIES AND CLASSIFIES BASED ON A THRESHOLD (DEFAULT 0.5).
5.  **VALIDATION:** COMPARES METRICS AND COEFFICIENTS AGAINST SCIKIT-LEARN.

---

## 🏁 USAGE

1.  **SELECT THE NOTEBOOK:** START WITH `LogisticRegression.ipynb` FOR BASICS OR THE REGULARIZATION NOTEBOOK FOR ADVANCED CONCEPTS.
2.  **RUN THE CELLS:** EXECUTE PREPROCESSING AND TRAINING STEPS.
3.  **EXPERIMENT:** MODIFY `lambda_`, `penalty`, OR `learning_rate` TO SEE HOW THE DECISION BOUNDARY SHIFTS.

## 📈 RESULTS AND CONCLUSION

<div style="text-align: justify;">
THE CUSTOM IMPLEMENTATIONS ACHIEVED HIGH FIDELITY COMPARED TO SCIKIT-LEARN, VALIDATING THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE MATHEMATICS.

- **ACCURACY:** THE SCRATCH MODEL ACHIEVED `~89%` ACCURACY, MATCHING OR SLIGHTLY EXCEEDING THE SKLEARN BASELINE.
- **REGULARIZATION:** L2 AND ELASTIC NET SUCCESSFULLY SMOOTHED DECISION BOUNDARIES, REDUCING OVERFITTING RISKS.
- **COEFFICIENTS:** LEARNED WEIGHTS SHOWED CONSISTENT DIRECTIONALITY WITH SCIKIT-LEARN, CONFIRMING CORRECT GRADIENT DERIVATIONS.

THE PROJECT CONFIRMS THAT REGULARIZATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR CONTROLLED LEARNING AND THAT NUMERICAL STABILITY (EPSILON) IS CRITICAL FOR ROBUST IMPLEMENTATION.
</div>

### ✔ KEY OBSERVATIONS
- MIN-MAX SCALING IS MORE STABLE FOR SIGMOID ACTIVATIONS THAN Z-SCORE.
- LOWER THRESHOLDS INCREASE RECALL (GOOD FOR MEDICAL/SAFETY CASES).
- HIGHER THRESHOLDS INCREASE PRECISION (GOOD FOR SPAM/FRAUD CASES).
- ELASTIC NET PROVIDES A BALANCED REGULARIZATION STRATEGY.

---

## 🚀 FUTURE WORK

- IMPLEMENT **MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION** (ONE-VS-ALL).
- ADD **NEWTON'S METHOD** FOR FASTER OPTIMIZATION.
- IMPLEMENT OTHER MODELS FROM SCRATCH.
