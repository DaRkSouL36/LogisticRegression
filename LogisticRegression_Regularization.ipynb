    "- IN REAL-WORLD MACHINE LEARNING, MODELS DO NOT FAIL BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO SIMPLE, THEY FAIL BECAUSE THEY **LEARN TOO MUCH**.\n",
    "- THIS PHENOMENON IS CALLED **OVERFITTING**.\n",
    "- REGULARIZATION IS A TECHNIQUE USED TO PREVENT **OVERFITTING** BY PENALIZING LARGE WEIGHTS ($\\theta$).\n",
    "- IT ADDS A `\"COMPLEXITY TERM\"` TO THE COST FUNCTION, FORCING THE MODEL TO KEEP PARAMETERS SMALL AND SIMPLE.\n",
